If someone with a lot of money wants to open a new shopping mall in L.A., data science should come in to help.\n\nLet's assume we are helping some major stakeholders who want to pick an address in L.A. to oopen up a new shopping mall. We are trying to find out locations which are the most profitable. We will use methodologies like data science and machine learning to solve this problem based on some models we can build (e.g. clustering models).\n\nSo what is an ideal location is Los Angeles to open a new shopping mall? This will be the problem we stick to in the following process of exploring.\n\n"
